I like [Intel Galileo](http://arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelGalileo), which is a microcontroller board based on the Intel Quark SoC X1000 Application Processor.
The processor is a 32-bit Intel Pentium system on a chip.
However, Intel’s Linux image is limited.
In his blog, [Sergey Kiselev](http://www.malinov.com/Home/sergey-s-blog/intelgalileo-buildinglinuximage) gives an introduction on how to build a Linux Standard Base (LSB) Image, which is more flexible than Intel’s image.
