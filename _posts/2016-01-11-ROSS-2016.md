I like the [International Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/events/workshops/ross/2016/cfp-ross2016.txt) (ROSS), which will held in 2016 in conjunction with [International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing](http://www.hpdc.org/2016/) (HPDC 2016).
It will take place in the Kyoto International Community House, Kyoto, Japan. I recommend this workshop and hope as PC member to receive a huge number of excellent submissions.
