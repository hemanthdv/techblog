Jumping from legacy modes like 32-bit protected to the 64-bit mode of current x86 processors is difficult and error-prone.
In his blog, Philipp Oppermann published an [excellent guide](http://os.phil-opp.com/entering-longmode.html) for switching the processor mode.
In principle, I use a similar way to boot [HermitCore](http://www.hermitcore.org) parallel to the Linux kernel.
In this case, the cores start in real mode (16-bit), switch to the protected mode (32-bit) and afterwards to the long mode (64-bit).
My boot code is published via [GitHub](https://github.com/RWTH-OS/linux/blob/hermit/arch/x86/hermit/boot.asm).
