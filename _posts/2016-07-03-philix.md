Intel's Xeon Phi processor is an interesting platform for operating system developers.
However, a simple way to boot third-party operating systems isn't supported by Intel.
A boot loader like grub simplifies the procedure by its [Multiboot Specification](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/).
In a small [tutorial](https://techblog.lankes.org/tutorials/smallest-helloworld-of-the-world-or-not/), I show how a kernel can be loaded by this grub feature.
Unfortunately, grub doesn't support Intel's Xeon Phi accelerator, but [Kyle Hale](http://halek.co) closes this gap with the help of [philix](http://philix.halek.co).
philix is a Linux command-line tool for booting third-party operating systems on the Intel Xeon Phi accelerator.
It looks very promising...
