In conjunction with [Euro-Par 2013](http://www.europar2013.org/), Carsten Clau√ü and I organize the [1st Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for the Many-core Era](https://wrome.github.io/aachen2013/) (ROME 2013), which will be held on August 26, 2013.
I think this will be a great opportunity to present research results in the area of operating systems and runtime systems.
