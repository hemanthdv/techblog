Like the year before, I am co-organizer of the [3rd Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for the Many-core Era (ROME 2015)](http://wrome.github.io/vienna2015/), which is held in conjunction with [Euro-Par 2015](http://www.europar2015.org/) in Vienna, Austria.
I hope that workshop will be as successful as the last one.
