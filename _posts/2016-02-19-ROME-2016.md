Like the year before, I am co-organizer of the [4th Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for the Many-core Era (ROME 2016)](http://wrome.github.io/grenoble2016/), which is held in conjunction with [Euro-Par 2016](https://europar2016.inria.fr/) in Grenoble, France.
I hope that workshop will be as successful as the last one.
