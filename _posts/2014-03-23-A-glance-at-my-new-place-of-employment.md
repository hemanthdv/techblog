I am glad to take office at the [Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems](http://www.acs.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de) at [E.ON Energy Research Center](http://www.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de), [RWTH Aachen University], with challenges in the area of high performance computing.
So far my I am really enjoing the new job and the place of employment is beautiful.
